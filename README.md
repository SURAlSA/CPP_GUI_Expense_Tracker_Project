# CPP_GUI_Expense_Tracker_Project
A GUI version based off my Python Terminal Expense Tracker Program. This is being written in C++ using SDL2 as its graphics.

v0.2.0
to compile, simply enter the root directy in the terminal(the same folder location as the Makefile executable) and type make.
There will be warnings about unused variables, simply ignore them for now as they have not been implemented in this version.
